# Simple Habit Tracker 

## Overview

A very simple tracker that allows me to check off things from a daily list. 

## Problem Statement

I often forget to take care of myself, particularly when I get busy. So I'm keeping a list of nudges that ensure my physical and mental well-being. The idea is to check off most things on most days, to feel good and stay healthy! 

## Solution

The solution is a simple list. I want to collect data over time and track how I'm doing. I don't want to pay for yet another app I may not use, and I'd like the data to stay somewhere I can slide and dice it if I feel like doing so. It should have some level of security so only I can access it, but I want to access it from anywhere. 


The simplest version of this is AppsScript + Google Sheets on my Drive. I set up a list. Each day, I check things off and hit a reset button at the end of the day. The data is added to the DB tab on the same sheet, and list resets for the next day. Once this becomes habit, I can add "features" e.g., flag when a habit is being neglected. 

## Features

* List of items with checkboxes
* Data tracked in the same sheet
* Reset button - usable from desktop and mobile
* Future ideas: Neglect flag, Add configurable definition of neglect, Ability to adjust habits over time, Analytics with the data

## Next Steps

* Build and deploy prototype
* Add to GitHub
* Plan and execute first extension from feature list
* ooh this is cool
